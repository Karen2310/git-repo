                    The mythical Billy returns, the fish who became so famous
                    because he sings and moves in a super fun way. Now he's back
                    with his one and only rendition of Gloria Gaynor's hit song "I 
                    will survive."
                    You can hang it from a parted thanks to its two upper holes on
                    the back or standing on any surface with the easel that it has
                    on the back.

                    If you don't know Billy, we'll introduce him to you. It is a fish
                    with a vocation for a singer that ir on a place. When you push
                    the button on the license plate, Billy starts singing the song "I 
                    will survive" and moves as he sings it. In addition, at the back
                    you can activate the motion sensor wich will make when 
                    someone passes in front of Billy, start singing.
